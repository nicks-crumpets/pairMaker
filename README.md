# Pair maker
A program designed to create one way pairs of names

## Instructions

1. Open 'names.csv' with notepad (or any text editor) and add as many names as you like, with a new line for each name, save and close the file when you're done
2. Run the program! It should print out a randomised order, and if you want a clearer view, open the 'results.csv' file in a spreadsheet viewer or text editor (calc, excel etc.)
